# 📦 Images and Containers

Understanding images and containers is essential to working with Docker effectively.

---

## 🖼️ What Are Images?

**Docker images** are:

* Templates used to create containers
* Snapshots of an application at a specific point in time
* **Immutable** — once created, they do not change

If you need to update an image, you must **rebuild** it.

### Why immutability matters:

* Ensures consistent behavior across environments
* Prevents unexpected changes or configuration drift

---

## 🚀 What Are Containers?

**Containers** are **running instances** of images.

* If an image is a **recipe**, a container is the **final dish**
* Containers are what actually execute your application
* You can start, stop, restart, or remove them at any time

Images = blueprint
Containers = live, running application

## 🧰 Dockerfile (How Images Are Created)

A **Dockerfile** is a text file containing instructions used to build an image.

It typically includes:

* The base image to use (`FROM`)
* Files to copy into the container (`COPY`)
* Commands to run inside the image (`RUN npm install`, etc.)
* Default commands for the container (`CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT`)

Docker reads the Dockerfile **step-by-step** to assemble an image.

## ✅ Summary

* Images → templates for containers, immutable and consistent
* Containers → running instances of images
* Dockerfile → instructions for building custom images
* Understanding these components gives you the foundation to use Docker confidently
