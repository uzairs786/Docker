# 🌐 Introduction to Docker Networking

Networking is essential in Docker (and IT in general).
For containers to work together — share data, communicate, and form microservices — they need a reliable networking model.

Docker networking allows containers to communicate:

* with each other
* with the host
* or with nothing at all (if isolated intentionally)

---

## 🧩 Core Networking Commands

You’ll commonly use:

```bash
docker network ls        # list networks
docker network create    # create a custom network
docker network connect   # attach a container to a network
```

These help you manage how containers interact.

## 🔌 Docker’s Default Network Types

Docker provides three built-in network modes:

---

### 1. 🟦 Bridge Network (Default)

* Default mode for containers on the **same machine**
* Containers communicate using their **private IPs**
* Isolated from the host machine
* Good security separation

**Analogy:**
Rooms in a house communicating through an internal intercom system.

---

### 2. 🟩 Host Network

* Container uses the **host’s network directly**
* No network isolation
* Container shares the host’s IP and ports
* Useful when an app must interact closely with the host system

**Analogy:**
A device plugged directly into the home router with no separation from the house network.

---

### 3. 🔒 None Network

* **No network access at all**
* Container is fully isolated
* No interfaces, no connections

**Analogy:**
A sealed room with no doors or windows.

Used for high-security scenarios.

## 🧱 Why Networking Matters in DevOps

Docker networking makes **microservices** possible:

* Each service runs in its **own container**
* Networking allows them to interact seamlessly
* Works whether the containers are on the same machine or distributed
* Highly scalable — easy to add/remove services

This is the backbone of modern DevOps environments.

## ✅ Summary

* Docker networking enables communication between containers
* Three main network types: **bridge**, **host**, **none**
* Bridge = default isolated network
* Host = no isolation, direct host access
* None = full isolation
* Networking is crucial for microservices and scalable containerized systems
